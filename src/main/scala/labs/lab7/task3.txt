Arbiter: Fixed-priority scheme, where the highest-priority requester is always granted access 
if it makes a request. This can lead to starvation for lower-priority requesters.

RRArbiter: Round-robin scheme, which ensures that all requesters get access in a cyclic order, 
preventing starvation and ensuring fairness.
